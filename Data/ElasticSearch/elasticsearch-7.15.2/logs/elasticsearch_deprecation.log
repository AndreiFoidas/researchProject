[2021-11-21T16:15:43,837][DEPRECATION][o.e.d.x.s.s.SecurityStatusChangeListener] [DESKTOP-DMIHS81] The default behavior of disabling security on basic licenses is deprecated. In a later version of Elasticsearch, the value of [xpack.security.enabled] will default to "true" , regardless of the license level. See https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/security-minimal-setup.html to enable security, or explicitly disable security by setting [xpack.security.enabled] to false in elasticsearch.yml
